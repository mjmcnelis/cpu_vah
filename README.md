## Summary
A 3+1d relativistic hydrodynamic simulation for heavy-ion collisions

The C++ module is based off the hydrodynamic code [GPU VH](https://github.com/bazow/gpu-vh.git)
    
CPU VAH can run three hydrodynamic models with shear and bulk viscosity

    VAH = anisotropic hydrodynamics
    VH  = second-order viscous hydrodynamics (quasiparticle)
    VH2 = second-order viscous hydrodynamics (standard)

## Compile and run
To compile and run *n* hydro events with default runtime `parameters`

    sh hydro.sh n  

Results from the simulation are stored in `output`\
Semi-analytic solutions (e.g. Bjorken and Gubser) are stored in `semi_analytic`

The above script clears the previous results prior to compiling.\
Alternatively, you can clear the results once by doing

    sh clear_results.sh
    make clean
    make
    for((i = 1; i <= n; i++))   # n = number of events (or jobs)
    do
        ./cpu_vah               # or submit your job
    done
    
This routine is often used by the job submissions in `scripts/`


## Compiler

By default, the code uses the `gcc` compiler (assumes no OpenMP support).\
Alternatively, you could use the `icpc` compiler (assumes OpenMP support)

You can switch out the Makefile by doing

    sh makefiles.sh icpc    (or gcc)
    

## Installation

You need to install the GSL libaries `-lgsl` and `-lgslcblas`\
The `icpc` compiler assumes the OpenMP library `-qopenmp` is installed

To use the `icpc` compiler, install `intel/19.0.3`\
To run the python3 scripts (i.e. sample model parameters and train auto-grid), install `python/3.6` 

To run CPU VAH with the Intel compiler on the Ohio State Supercomputer (OSC), do
    
    sh makefile.sh icpc
    module load python/3.6
    module load intel/19.0.3


## Files

The C++ source and header files are located in `rhic`


## Runtime parameters

You can edit the runtime `parameters`

    hydro.properties
    initial.properties
    lattice.properties
    
The most important runtime parameters to adjust are

    run_hydro                           1 to output hydrodynamic quantites
                                        2 to construct the freezeout surface
                                        
    kinetic_theory_model                0 to run VH2 (comment macro ANISO_HYDRO)
                                        1 to run VH  (comment macro ANISO_HYDRO)

    trento_fixed_seed                   0 to set seed = clocktime
                                        x > 0 to fix seed = x (e.g. 1000)

    resolve_nucleon_width               0 to use customized transverse lattice_spacing_x(y)
                                        1 to set lattice_spacing_x(y) = w/5 (w = nucleon width parameter)
                                                                            (transverse grid size is preserved)

    auto_grid                           0 to use the customized spatial grid
                                        1 to automate the transverse grid lengths (need to run sh.predict_fireball_radius.sh)
    
    adaptive_time_step                  0 to set time step to fixed_time_step

The Bayesian model parameters *P<sub>B</sub>* can be replaced during runtime.\
To generate *s* model parameter samples, go to `scripts/auto_grid` and do

    sh sample_model_parameters.sh s        
    
The model parameter samples are stored in `python/model_parameters`

Then run *n* hydro events with `model_parameters_p.dat`  (*p* âˆˆ [1, *s*])

    sh hydro.sh n p    

or simply run the executable

    ./cpu_vah p


## Macro parameters

You can edit the macro parameters in `rhic/include`

    Macros.h
    OpenMP.h
    
The most important macro parameters to adjust are
    
    ANISO_HYDRO         (run anisotropic hydro; comment to run second-order viscous hydro)
    BOOST_INVARIANT     (run 2+1d hydro; comment to run 3+1d hydro)
    CONFORMAL_EOS       (comment to use QCD equation of state)
    FREEZEOUT_VH        (write viscous hydrodymamic variables on freezeout surface for iS3D)
    JETSCAPE            (store the freezeout surface in memory; comment to output surface.dat)
    FLAGS               (to print warnings during runtime)
    PRINT_PARAMETERS    (to print the runtime parameters)
    
    OPENMP              (accelerate simulation with OpenMP)
